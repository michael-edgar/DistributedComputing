</P>Some people are against the practice of some less-enlightened Webmasters of 
designing Web pages that are tailored specifically to one or another browser's 
own version of HTML, or which work only with one particular browser. The worst 
offenders are certainly <A href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape 
Communications Corp.</A>'s Navigator and <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>'s Internet Explorer. In response, 
then, those more-enlightened HTML hackers decided to create the 'Best Viewed 
with Any Browser' campaign, which more or less says (in one of many ways) that 
browser-specificity in HTML is a Bad Thing, and we should all design to the spec 
instead of being bug-compatible with whatever beta version is currently shipping 
from the major software houses. This is basically the right idea, but really, it 
could be refined a bit, in my opinion. 
<P>Therefore, I have decided to institute the <B>Best Viewed with telnet to port 
80</B> initiative. This is a name which refers to the common system 
administration practice of connecting to server ports with telnet to verify that 
they are listening for connections and functioning properly. Port 80 is the 
standard port for HyperText Transport Protocol, the protocol used for 
transferring Web pages over the Internet. (Contrary to popular belief, the terms 
'Web' and 'Internet' are *not* synonymous or even generally interchangeable.) 
For more information about port numbers, please check <A 
href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1700.html">RFC 1700</A>, Internet Assigned 
Numbers, J. Reynolds &amp; J. Postel, October 1994. 
<P>It is fairly simple to view the HTML source to a web page by means of telnet 
to port 80. For example, suppose you have the following URL (Uniform Resource 
Locator also known as a Web address): 
<ADDRESS>&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/officers.html</ADDRESS>
<P>The various parts of the URL are as follows: 
<DL>
  <DT><CODE>http://</CODE> 
  <DD>Means that the protocol "http", or HyperText Transport Protocol, is to be 
  used to retrieve this item. 
  <DT><CODE>www.csua.berkeley.edu</CODE> 
  <DD>Means that the item is stored on the host with the address 
  "www.csua.berkeley.edu". 
  <DT><CODE>/officers.html</CODE> 
  <DD>Means that, according to the Web server, the name of this item is 
  "/officers.html". </DD></DL>So, therefore, to retrieve the Web page with the 
address shown above, you must first connect to the HyperText Transport Protocol 
server on the host <CODE>www.csua.berkeley.edu</CODE>, which is canonically 
located on port 80, as noted above. The command or sequence of commands for 
connecting to ports other than 23 (the Telnet server port) using your Telnet 
client vary from system to system. 
<P>For example, if you are connecting from a VMS system running UCX, give this 
command at your DCL prompt: <PRE>   $ TELNET www.csua.berkeley.edu /PORT=80
</PRE>to connect to the host www.csua.berkeley.edu on port 80. Unix users, or 
users of systems like Unix, should consult the on-line manual page 
<B><CODE>telnet</CODE>(1)</B> for details; if you are not familiar with the Unix 
online manual, type <PRE>   % man man
</PRE>for details. 
<P>Once you have connected to the HTTP server on the server host, you will not 
be prompted to enter any information; however, the Web server is awaiting your 
request. You have to issue a HTTP request in order to retrieve the page, which 
in our example is named "/officers.html" on the server. 
<P>To retrieve Web documents using HTTP, the client (you) must issue a GET 
request. The syntax of a GET request is as follows: <BR><B>GET</B> document-name 
HTTP-version<BR>where: 
<DL>
  <DT><B><CODE>document-name</CODE></B> 
  <DD>is the name of the Web page you are retrieving as it is known by the 
  server; in our example, that is "/officers.html". 
  <DT><B><CODE>HTTP-version</CODE></B> 
  <DD>is the version of HTTP your client understands. Mostly this does not 
  matter when you are viewing pages using telnet to port 80; therefore, it is 
  sufficient to specify "HTTP/1.0" as the version. </DD></DL>
<P>Note, however, that all HTTP requests must end in a CRLF sequence (carriage 
return and line feed); how you do this depends somewhat on the keyboard, 
terminal or terminal emulator, and Telnet client you are using; there are enough 
combinations of these that the reader is advised to try different combinations 
of RETURN, Control-J, Enter, and/or Control-J until something works; note that 
it is nontrivial to do this from NCSA Telnet 2.7b4 for the Macintosh if 
"Berkeley 4.3 CR mode" is set in the Sessions preference box. (This particular 
option relies on a bug in the TCP/IP stack of early versions of 4.3 BSD Unix, 
which expected an ASCII NUL (0) to be sent after carriage return characters.) 
<P>What works to send requests on my machine, which is probably but not 
necessarily unlike your machine, is a sequence of Control-M then Control-J. So 
when you have typed the GET request, which in the example shown above should 
look like: <PRE>  GET /officers.html HTTP/1.0
</PRE>type a CRLF, and then you should be rewarded by a HTTP response, which may 
or may not include an arbitrary amount of HTML. 
<P>You should also make sure to enter GET and HTTP in all uppercase; many web 
servers require this. 
<P>The first thing to check is whether you have actually received the document 
you wanted. You can usually tell by looking at the first line of the HTTP 
response, which should include a line like the following: <PRE>  HTTP/1.0 Nnn Response text
</PRE>where 
<DL>
  <DT><B>Nnn</B> 
  <DD>is a three-digit code that specifies the response type. Codes that start 
  with 2 are responses (the most common type being 200 (Document follows)), 
  codes that start with 3 are deferred successes (for example, 301 (Moved 
  permanently)), and codes that start with 4 or 5 are failures (again, a common 
  type is 404 (Page not found.)) 
  <DT><B>Response text</B> 
  <DD>is a human-readable response type that corresponds to the three-digit code 
  explained above. Some common response texts are shown in the previous 
  definition. </DD></DL>
<P>You know that you received the correct document by two simple heuristics: 
<UL>
  <LI>You see the message '200 Document follows' in the beginning of the HTTP 
  response. 
  <LI>You see the document you expected to see. (This is more of a common-sense 
  operation than anything else.) </LI></UL>You know that you did <EM>not</EM> 
receive the correct document by another simple heuristic: 
<UL>
  <LI>A response code other than 200 (Document follows) was sent by the server. 
  <LI>This is usually one of the following responses: 
  <UL>
    <LI>301 Moved Permanently 
    <LI>302 Moved Temporarily - <BR>The document exists, and the server knows 
    its actual location, but it is not where you thought it was. Rather than 
    actually just giving you the document, it is being stubborn and making you 
    go get it yourself. The body of the HTML text returned by the server, if 
    any, should reference the new location of the document; the HTTP response 
    header should contain a Refresh: or Location: tag whose value should 
    reference the new URL as well. 
    <LI>403 Forbidden - <BR>The document is not available to you, either by 
    administrative fiat or by Webmaster brain-damage. Most likely this 
    translates into some rule which is preventing your access; most likely it is 
    a rule implemented on the server. Oftentimes it is merely a question of 
    access privilege. Indeed, it could simply be the rule that you cannot obtain 
    a document whose URL you cannot spell. In any case, if you are sure of the 
    address you had better check the settings on the server before complaining 
    to the administrator. 
    <LI>404 Not Found - <BR>The document you requested does not exist on the 
    server under the name by which you requested it. You should <EM>NOT</EM>, 
    however, complain to the Webmaster of the server before verifying that the 
    document is supposed to be at the address you supplied, or before making a 
    good-faith effort to determine whether the document is located somewhere 
    else on the same server, or perhaps on another server. This error could also 
    indicate that you cannot type very well, but it is up to you to determine 
    whether this is indeed the case. 
    <LI>500 Server Error - <BR>The server is failing due to some configuration 
    problem on its own part, or the webmaster's; there is nothing you can do and 
    you should close up your Telnet client and go home, preferably hitting 
    several squirrels out of sheer rage during your commute. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>If you have not been able to access the document, you should make sure the 
URL is spelled correctly; then and only then contact the webmaster if and only 
if you are <EM>certain</EM> that the document is supposed to be on that server 
<EM>and</EM> you have made reasonable attempts to search for it elsewhere on the 
server as well as elsewhere on the network. 
<P>Assuming that you have successfully retrieved something from the server, one 
of the last header lines will be of the format: <PRE>  Content-type: mime-type
</PRE>where <B>mime-type</B> is some data-type defined by MIME, the Multipurpose 
Internet Mail Extensions. Most likely, if you have requested a HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language) document, you will get a Content-type tag of 
<CODE>text/html</CODE>, and after a blank line, will follow the HTML you 
requested. If you were unlucky, you will have a Content-type of 
<CODE>image/gif</CODE> or <CODE>image/jpeg</CODE>, and the data returned by the 
HTTP request will be some sort of compressed raster image data. Implementing 
parsers for CompuServe(R) GIF data is a violation of the LZW patent held by 
Unisys, and is not recommended; implementing parsers for JPEG compressed images 
in the human brain is beyond the scope of this document. 
<P>For a guide to interpreting HTML, the reader is advised to check out any of 
the many good on-line documentations of HTML which are available from the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</A>'s official <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/">HTML page</A>; using the SGML DTD to 
parse HTML if you are not yourself a SGML parser is not advised. 
<P>
<H3>Goal of the 'Best viewed with telnet to port 80' campaign</H3>There are 
several advantages to not using a browser to read Web pages. One of the most 
obvious is that it lets the user debug erroneous HTML code into a form which 
<EM>can</EM> be read by a less sophisticated parser, such as that found in a 
browser. 
<P>Another important point is that the Web browsers of today are exceedingly 
inefficient in terms of both RAM and disk footprint, and tend to use grossly 
bloated object-oriented coding styles. Many computers cannot run the latest Web 
browsers, such as 68020-based Macintoshes; some cannot run Web browsers at all, 
such as those based on the PIC microcontroller, the Z80 or the Motorola 68HC09. 
Using a bare TCP/IP stack and a Telnet client is much more efficient, especially 
as Telnet clients come with most implementations of TCP/IP (and, indeed, most 
modern operating systems); therefore no additional investment of disk space is 
necessary. 
<P>Probably the most important reason for the <B>Best Viewed with telnet to port 
80 </B>campaign is that it is time to realize what it means to disregard 
standards documents when implementing popular protocols: it is an undercutting 
of the standard itself, such that if enough people attempt to use the 
implementation you have written which does not conform to the standard, then 
they will start to design against your bugs and/or shortcomings, and to employ 
features that are not specified in the standard (thus making the protocol you 
have implemented only partially compatible with the standard, which is the 
definition of the protocol.) 
<P>Feel free to use the <B>Best Viewed by telnet to port 80</B> button on your 
web page, if you wish; just please don't modify it, because then it wouldn't 
conform to the standard. <CODE>;-)</CODE>

<P>Some people are <B>really</B> impressed with the Best Viewed with Telnet to 
Port 80 initiative. I even got some hate mail about it. Nevertheless, I have 
since received an apology from the sender; apparently it was a case of someone 
using someone else's account for mischief. So the letter is no longer online.
